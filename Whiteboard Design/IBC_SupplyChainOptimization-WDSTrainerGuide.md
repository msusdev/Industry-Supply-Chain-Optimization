## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the points you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions from the participants.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session  

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

**Have fun!** Encourage participants to have fun and share!

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get participants to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Supply Chain Optimization whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Parts Unlimited, a subsidiary of Fabrikam Retail INC., has been feeling some pain and would like your help to redesign and implement some new solutions to be able to better compete in the current marketplace.  Among the main problems that Parts Unlimited is facing are 

*   Lack of connection between online and in-store data leading to an inability to provide a selection optimization that is tailored to a specific customer
*   Lack of infrastructure to maximize cost savings through correct inventory levels
*   Poor last-mile delivery
*   Departments operate in silos so they cannot communicate due to disparate data sources.
*   Limited visibility of data with no feedback loop on the supply chain.
*   Affecting changes to the supply chain is not a trivial endeavor. 
*   No current 360 degree view of the supply chain. 

To remedy this situation, Parts Unlimited is asking you to build a system that takes all of the supply-chain data and ingests it into IoT and Event Hubs as necessary, then performs analysis on the data.

Key success criteria will include 

*   Contract Cycle data and optimization
*   Available to promise capabilities
*   Price-elasticity analysis
*   Route planning and scheduling
*   Demand forecasting

Included in the analysis and processing will be data from 
*   Point of sale transactions
*   Purchase data from all channels
*   Device/Sensor data from IoT devices
*   Warehouse logistical and operational data
*   Social media sentiment and analysis

The primary goal for this system is to conglomerate all of the data into a single source of truth for use in reporting, bringing together all of the moving pieces from the supply chain.  

In the end, your solution should provide a vision that allows the audience (the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager) to understand how using this solution will give the information that is needed to deliver a 360 degree view of the supply chain.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Parts Unlimited Retail, Inc has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years.  As various platforms and technologies have evolved, Parts Unlimited has struggled to keep up, but has done the best they could to continue to provide solutions for their customers.  

Currently, they have just over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but are planning to close 50+ of these stores next year, taking the number of physical locations down to 150 stores due to declining revenue and various other factors.  Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago.  The re-branded stores were chosen based on population bases of less than 50,000 in an 200 square mile radius or within 50 miles of a major metropolitan area. These rebranded "Parts Unlimited Hometown" stores eliminated most of the non-essential retail, such as sporting and workout equipment, and focused in on essentials like appliances, automotive, and kept a limited selection of electronics, only offering about 15% of the options for items like UHD televisions, antennas, and blu-ray players.  Customers have expressed frustrations when an advertisement in the local newspaper for Parts Unlimited included a great deal on a large-screen television only to find they have to order online or drive to the larger store in a city that is sometimes located over 50 miles away.  While it is clear that customers are not pleased with this solution, it is not clear if this is an effective strategy to save the company when it comes to providing a simplified retail option. 

In addition to re-branding efforts, in the past few years attempts have been made to enhance the web app for responsive delivery and a couple of apps were also built to specifically target IOS and Android devices. Unfortunately, the data from these applications and the web solution is not connected, and when a user switches devices or goes from a device to the web, the experience is not uniform, leading to confusion and frustration.  Questions such as "why isn't the item I selected on my phone in my cart when I go to the website?" are far too common.    

Parts Unlimited needs an ability to collect and analyze all of this data in order to make the best uniform solution possible.   The final solution from this challenge workshop should provide an ability for Parts Unlimited to take control of their supply chain so that customers can know when and where products are going to be available, and that stores can be prepared to keep up with expected demands.  

While there are clearly other issues at play that Parts Unlimited needs to solve, the solution you are creating in this workshop needs to allow for a user to be able to walk into a brick-and-mortar store and get the items they are looking for, and for the stores to have the ability to meet demand based on an optimized supply chain. 

This goal of improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360 degree view of the supply chain, with data analysis and reporting that provides the business the ability to plan and schedule deliveries of products according to forecasted needs, based on customer sentiment current buying trends.

#### Customer's current process

Parts Unlimited currently has over 200 brick-and-mortar stores, with 50+ stores closing and 35 stores running the re-branded profile.  Some stores have a pre-determined, limited selection and a limited inventory of the products they do offer. 

Parts Unlimited has an MVC website written in the .Net Framework and has been previously upgraded to version 4.72. The website is supposed to be responsive, as it utilized Bootstrap for responsive layout, but the site is currently not able to work on a few devices due to some styling problems.  

In addition to the website, Parts Unlimited has an Android application written in native Java that is three versions behind the current version of Android, but has been upgraded enough to continue to work on newer devices, even though it does not necessarily leverage all of the features of newer devices.  

Along with the website and android app, a third app written in Swift is available for use on the Apple IOS devices.  

All applications and sites do work, but the user experience, including sign-on, shopping cart, and other factors is unique to each platform.  For example, a user must sign in on the website and then sign in again on the device, and the shopping cart is not shared across devices, so items added to the cart on the web do not show up on the phone, or vice-versa.

As a struggling retailer, Parts Unlimited has a limited amount of resources to apply to getting the entire experience upgraded, so they need you to come up with the best, cost-effective solution.   

When it comes to supply chain management, Parts Unlimited is not very efficient.  They currently have five different departments, all siloed, and none of the departments are working together to get to the overall vision that Parts Unlimited needs.  This is in addition to separate databases used to track products, orders, and customers for the online and the physical store inventory and ordering systems.

The current reporting systems live on top of four different systems with five total silos.  They are as follows:

*   SAP for Demand Planning
*   SAP for Financials
*   Salesforce CRM
*   JD Edwards EDI
*   Oracle Retail ERP

### Customer needs

1.  Use Azure data and analytics tools to create a 360 degree view of the supply chain.

2.  Ingest data from existing systems as defined, as well as other systems and future implementations (i.e. IoT Devices, Website and app telemetry for customer search and purchase data).  Data from point of sale transactions and purchase information should also be ingested.  

3.  Provide reporting to the business user to be able to make decisions around the contract cycle, delivery scheduling and route planning, and demand forecasting with price-elasticity metrics.

4.  Optimize warehouse inventory management and staff utilization to ensure all channels are working with efficiency and no under-staffing or over-staffing according to predicted demands.

5.  An optimized last-mile delivery plan to ensure that customers are getting their orders as quickly as possible.  

6.  An ability to use feedback in any step of the process, as well as give feedback based on findings.  

7.  Because the solution has optimized the supply chain, it will also be possible to optimize the customer return process to expedite returns and getting the products back on the shelves to be sold to other customers.  

### Customer objections

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, we can't just throw it all away and start over.

3.  It seems like this is a lot of speculation. How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from suppliers to the warehouses and then to the stores any more quickly than we already do this?  People can only plan so fast and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards. 

4.  The amount of work and time that it is going to take to implement this is going to be too much.  Right now if you change one part of the process the ripple effect could be very significant for the final delivery of the products to the correct stores and/or customers.

5.  It will be logistically and economically difficult to work with the other departments that are siloed - we can't afford to get our accounting team up to speed on EDI or our EDI team up to speed on customer management.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With all participants at your table, answer the following questions and list the answers on a flip chart:

1. Who should you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table, respond to the following questions on a flip chart:

_High-level architecture_

1. Without getting into the details (the following sections will address the particular details), diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for 

*   Identification of data sources
*   Ingestion of streaming data from sources
*   Organization and/or filtering of data
*   Creating the expected reports
*   Presentation of data to the business users

_Data ingest_

2. Of the ingest options you identified previously, which would you recommend for Parts Unlimited's scenario?

_Data transformation_

1. Will data transformation be needed?

2. If so, Which option would you recommend and why?  

3. Will there need to be a hot and a cold path on this data? 

_Data processing_

1. How will you filter the data to get relevant information?

2. How will you ensure that data processes are repeatable?

_Dashboards and reporting_

1. Parts Unlimited's business analysts would like to have a set of dashboards they can monitor that provide real-time views of supply chain data. What do you propose using to meet this requirement? Be specific about how this solution will be put in place and which features it supports, and why it will be useful to the business analysts.

2. Parts Unlimited's marketing team would like to be able to get insights from the data, and be able to identify trends, as well as see how effective various pricing strategies are.   How will you provide this data to them to enable them to ensure an optimal customer experience?

**Prepare**

Directions: With all participants at your table:

1.  Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2.  Identify the benefits of your solution.

3.  Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1.  Pair with another table.

2.  One table is the Microsoft team and the other table is the customer.

3.  The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4.  The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5.  The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6.  The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

7.  Tables switch roles and repeat Steps 2-6.

## Wrap-up

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.

# Supply Chain Optimization whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

- Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer.

- Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

- Briefly review the steps and timeframes of the whiteboard design session.

- Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin.

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

- Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.

- Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.

  - Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

- Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.

  - Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

## Step 3: Present the solution

- Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.

- For the first round, assign one table as the presenting team and the other table as the customer.

- Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team.

  - Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to.

  - The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes.

  - If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

- Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred target audience

Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer,
Chief Data Officer, Customer Experience
Manager

## Preferred solution  

![The Preferred solution](media/sco/SCOPreferred.png 'Current process diagram') 
 
_High-level architecture_  

For this solution, you will need to ingest data from multiple sources.  Originally, there are 4 sources of truth across five silos.  Additionally, there will likely be data that needs to be ingested from devices and other channels as Parts Unlimited builds out their new retail solutions.  Using Azure data factory and/or IoT and Event Hubs, bring all the data together into Azure Data lake and Azure Databricks. Then using Synapse analytics, machine learning, and analysis services, generate the final data that will be used in the reports. 
 
_Data ingest_

To get all the data, you will need to be able to ingest data from the various sources that exist as well as potentially respond to devices and other channels, so you'll have Azure Data Factory, an IoT Hub, and potentially an EventHub.  You will then likely use other tools to transform the data and filter the results for presentation.

_Data processing_

Data ingested will be moved from Azure Data Factory to Azure Data Lake storage, where it will be fed into Azure Synapse Analytics Spark tools to analyze and transform the data for presentation.  Information from IoT devices and event hub will be moved by Azure Stream Analytics into CosmosDB for analysis in Azure Synapse Analytics services.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?  

    While you currently have all the data, you do not have a solution that allows for all of the analysts to see every part of the data to gain clarity on how the supply chain can be optimized.  This solution will provide a 360 degree vision of the entire process so that any analyst can find the information they need from a single source of truth, providing the opportunity to create better results more efficiently, and with a great deal more accuracy. 

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, we can't just throw it all away and start over.  

    You won't be throwing anything away.  The original reports may be retired, but your new solution will leverage the data that is currently in place.  Machine learning and data ingestion and transformation will allow for your solution to garner great results that you simply cannot currently get from the data as your system exists today. 

3.  It seems like this is a lot of speculation. How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from suppliers to the warehouses and then to the stores any more quickly than we already do this?  People can only plan so fast and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards.   

    The solution will help you to optimize this process.  While it's true that people can't work any more quickly and trucks can't drive faster than they currently do, having trucks that are fully loaded with the correct products and warehouses that are correctly and efficiently staffed while also having predictive analytics to help ensure you procure the correct products in a timely manner will be where the optimization of the process will excel. 

4.  The amount of work and time that it is going to take to implement this is going to be too much.  Right now if you change one part of the process the ripple effect could be very significant for the final delivery of the products to the correct stores and/or customers.

    This is a legitimate fear.  You don't want to make the process worse than it already is.  While it's true that sometimes you have to slow down to go fast, we are confident that we can implement a solution quickly that will give you valuable and actionable information that will not only prevent issues with your supply chain, but will ultimately optimize it.  

5.  It will be logistically and economically difficult to work with the other departments that are siloed - we can't afford to get our accounting team up to speed on EDI or our EDI team up to speed on customer management.  

    The great news about this solution is that everyone can still use what they know, but now they will have access to the other data they need.  By building out the robust reporting that is necessary, your teams will be able to get the data they are looking for without having to worry about other pieces that currently could cause problems for them.  Additionally, since the data is all available in the same system, there won't be any need to learn other processes or wait on other teams to get back to you with results.  

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"We are so pleased with the results offered through the provided solution.  We have truly achieved a 360 degree view of our supply chain, and we've been able to optimize our warehouse inventory and staffing.  We've seen a great reduction on the level of greater than 75% improvement on being able to deliver products and avoid both overstocking and understocking our stores.  Customer delivery time is also increased and we now have most deliveries completed within two days of an order being placed"
