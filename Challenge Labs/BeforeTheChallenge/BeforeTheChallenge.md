# Supply Chain Optimization before the challenge setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription (MSDN or Pay As You Go)

## Before the challenge

Duration: 10 minutes

In this guide, you will provision the mock environment and data for the Microsoft Industry Based Challenge "Supply Chain Optimization"

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Azure subscription -- MSDN or Pay-as-you-Go

### Task 1: Use Azure Shell

>**Note**: This guide can be completed using only the Azure Cloud Shell.

1.  In a web browser, navigate to https://shell.azure.com. Alternatively, from the Azure web portal, launch the **Azure Cloud Shell**. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

    ![This is a screenshot of an icon used to launch the Azure Cloud Shell from the Azure Portal.](media/azurecloud.png "Azure Cloud Shell launch icon")


### Task 2: Get the Deployment Template

1.  Create a new folder:

    ```bash  
    mkdir msibsupplychain
    cd msibsupplychain
    ```  

    ![This is a screenshot of the bash terminal with commands to make the directory and move to it for the msibcomnichannel directory](media/supplychainfolder.png "The directory msibcomnichannel is created and the terminal is ready to accept a new command")

1.  Using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can download the file by executing the following command inside the Cloud Shell window (all on one line):

    ```bash
    curl -o azuredeploy.json curl -o azuredeploy.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opsgilitybrian/PartsUnlimited5/main/azuredeploy.json
    ```  

    Then run 

    ```bash  
    ls
    ```  
    
    Ensure that you see a file `azuredeploy.json`.

    ![This is a screenshot that shows the progress to the point of having the azuredeploy.json file in the local folder at Azure](media/image2002.png "The ls command is executed to show that azuredeploy.json is in the local directory")

3.  When completed, you will have a new ARM template to deploy the app service plan, the app service, a SQL server and a database to simulate the following:  

    *   Web [The company's public-facing website]

   
4.  If you wish, you can review the ARM template.  

    What you will find is that with the template you will deploy the following resources per environment

    *   An App Service Plan for .Net in the F1 [Free] tier
    *   An App Service that is built and deployed based on code in a GitHub repository.  You will not modify this code for the challenge.  
    *   An Azure SQL Server 
    *   An Azure SQL Database in the Basic plan [$5/month]

    You will deploy four versions of the environment, so you will have four instances of SQL Server that will be accumulating cost.  The remaining resources should incur no charges.

### Task 3: Deploy the Environments

1. Within CloudShell, toggle from PowerShell to Bash using the selection on the top right of the terminal screen.
   
2. Navigate the prompt to the msibcomnichannel folder if you are not already there.

    ```bash  
    cd msibsupplychain
    ```  
   
3. Using the Azure CLI, create a new resource group  

    Name the resource group appropriately (such as msibc_omnichannel).  Set the location to the region nearest to you. 

    ```bash  
    rgName=msibsupplychain
    location=centralus
    echo $rgName
    echo $location
    ```  

    ![This is a screenshot of setting the variables for the upcoming scripts](media/image2003.png "Bash commands to create and show the values of two new variables")
    
    Once the group name and location are set to variables, create the group:  

    ```bash
    az group create --name $rgName --location "$location"  
    ```  

    ![This is a screenshot of the bash terminal with the command to create a new resource group shown](media/image2004.png "Bash command executed and the resource group details are shown when the command completed")

4. Deploy the template.

    Now that the resource group is completed, deploy the template with the following command:

    ```bash
    az deployment group create --resource-group $rgName --template-file "azuredeploy.json"  
    ```  

    For the first run, select `Web`.   

    You will be prompted to enter credentials for the SQL Server.  

    ```bash  
    msibcchallenger
    ```  

    ```bash
    msibc@chllngr123
    ```  

    ![This is a screenshot of the bash terminal with the command to create a group deployment in progress](media/image2005.png "Bash command executed to create the deployment group")



    Once completed, the following resources should appear within your Resource Group within the Azure Portal.
