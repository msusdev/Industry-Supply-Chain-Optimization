# Industry-Based Challenges: Supply Chain Optimization  

## Hands-on lab guide  

### March 2021  

## Abstract and learning objectives

Parts Unlimited, a subsidiary of Fabrikam Retail INC., has been feeling some pain and would like your help to redesign and implement some new solutions to be able to better compete in the current marketplace.  Among the main problems that Parts Unlimited is facing are 

*   Lack of connection between online and in-store data leading to an inability to provide a selection optimization that is tailored to a specific customer
*   Lack of infrastructure to maximize cost savings through correct inventory levels
*   Poor last-mile delivery
*   Departments operate in silos so they cannot communicate due to disparate data sources.
*   Limited visibility of data with no feedback loop on the supply chain.
*   Affecting changes to the supply chain is not a trivial endeavor. 
*   No current 360 degree view of the supply chain. 

To remedy this situation, Parts Unlimited is asking you to build a system that takes all of the supply-chain data and ingests it into IoT and Event Hubs as necessary, then performs analysis on the data.

Key success criteria will include 

*   Contract Cycle data and optimization
*   Available to promise capabilities
*   Price-elasticity analysis
*   Route planning and scheduling
*   Demand forecasting

Included in the analysis and processing will be data from 
*   Point of sale transactions
*   Purchase data from all channels
*   Device/Sensor data from IoT devices
*   Warehouse logistical and operational data
*   Social media sentiment and analysis

The primary goal for this system is to conglomerate all of the data into a single source of truth for use in reporting, bringing together all of the moving pieces from the supply chain.  

In the end, your solution should provide a vision that allows the audience (the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager) to understand how using this solution will give the information that is needed to deliver a 360 degree view of the supply chain.
